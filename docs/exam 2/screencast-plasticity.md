## overview

-   In this demo we add plasticity and measure the plastic zone from a previous class demo
-   To compare with Irwin/Dugdale, I will be using an elastic-perfectly plastic material model
-   To save time in this screencast I, I started from a previous demo, adding only plasticity
-   Note: the expression (solid.epe>0) returns 1 when the statement is true (i.e. there is plastic strain) and 0 otherwise, which makes it useful to find the extent of the plastic zone
