# finite specimen effects

## finite specimen effects

-   Up to this point, we have considered infinitely large panels
-   In general, the effect of finite size is modeled using numerical techniques, such as finite elements
-   These corrections will generally take the form of some dimensionless factor that is multiplied with the infinite stress intensity factor
-   <!-- .element style="list-style-type:none" --> `$$ K_I = \sigma \sqrt{\pi a} F(a/b, a/H) $$`

## williams crack tip fields

-   All the solutions we have found for the stress field near the crack tip have a singularity
-   Williams approached the solution in a slightly different way to expand the terms
