# elasticity

----
## topics

-   Boundary Conditions
	-   Cauchy's stress theorem
	-   Saint venant's principle
	-   Linear superposition
-   Stress transformation
-   Airy stress
-   Strain energy

----
## problems

-   Write BC's for some elasticity problem
-   Use Saint Venant's principle to write equivalent BC's
-   Dissect a problem into the sum of smaller problems
-   Outline Airy stress solution

---
# griffith fracture

----
## topics

-  Theoretical Strength
	-    Atomic strength 
	-    Strength proportional to stiffness 
	-    Imperfections
-  Griffith Fracture Theory
	-    Crack's exist in most materials 
	-    Energy required to create new crack surface 
	-    external work must equal the sum of work to create a new surface and the change in strain energy

----
## problems

-    strain energy release rate for simple geometry 
-    explain theoretical stress

---
# stress field

----
## topics

-    Fracture Modes
-    Westergaard Function
-    Fundamental Stress Intensity
-    K-dominance, fracture-based failure

----
## problems

-    Check BC's with given Westergaard 
-    Stress Intensity from $Z_I$, $Z_{II}$, or $Z_{III}$
-    K-dominance significance 
-    Calculate failure from fracture toughness
